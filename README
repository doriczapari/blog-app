This is a blog app I've been building for the Web Development course at Udacity.com. Not all of the code is by myself, it's rather a demonstration of what I've learned and understood after trial and error and explanations. 

The app is running at dori-udacity-cs253.appspot.com/blog. Try /blog/newpost and leave me a message until I don't fix it and you're able to :) 
See dori-udacity-cs253.appspot.com/rot13 and /signup for other stuff we made at the course.
